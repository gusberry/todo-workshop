# NODE - from 0 to TODO app

In this tutorial we will learn how to:

- setup your first server using `express`
- create and modify routes in your `REST API`
- connect to `DB`
- add `authorization` to your application
- migrate your app to `GraphQL`

The tutorial will consist from several steps 

```sh
npm i -g express-generator
```

```sh
express --no-view --git
```

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

Verify that server is up and running in your preferred browser.

```sh
localhost:8000
```
